## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[Youtube, w3schools, Stack Overflow]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I felt re-energized at the start of Winter quarter and was succeeding in my coursework, however in February, my parents tested positive for the omicron variant and were laid off from their agricultural work. Their employer told them that without having hours for sick leave, they were getting laid off because they could not come into work to sort and pack fruit during peak season. As the eldest son, I was responsible for taking care of them –both financially and physically– so I left back home to the lower Yakima Valley. I tried my best to balance school work and family obligations, but ultimately I had to prioritize my family’s well-being. I started working back to my old warehouse job at the Walmart Distribution Center where they pay good, but have long hours and difficult work conditions. It’s exhausting there because work starts at 3:00am and it’s fast-paced while lifting boxes all day in -20°F since my area was the Freezer. My parents were very sick for a month and this sudden situation took a detrimental toll on my mental health and academics. I was also not able to spend as much time as I would have liked with the project but to me, just being able to submit it and do a few of the optional features is a success to me!

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[’m curious about the process of making a website and what frameworks are best for each specific project. Also since there are websites that make websites for people, is web development going to be less in demand in the future? Is the future of web development going to be full of websites like Wix? I feel like a lot of people like the simplicity of Wix and it’s much cheaper than hiring a web developer to build the website. Also, it’s more accessible to people and since covid started there has been a surge in e-commerce businesses because people weren’t working and they couldn’t leave their homes.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours I would definitely want to try to get the rest of the optional features completed. It’s like I have to collect the rest of the features, sorta like video games and collectibles. A feature that I would have liked to implement into the game would be in-game purchases. For example, people could buy different shapes and designs, or even sounds that the buttons make. Maybe even different backgrounds. Ok maybe I would need more than a few hours but that’s what the gamer in me would have liked to have done with the project.]
